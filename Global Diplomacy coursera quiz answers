WEEK 1 ANSWER
Diplomacy is the art and science of maintaining peaceful relationships between nations, groups, or individuals. Often, diplomacy refers to representatives of different groups discussing such issues as conflict, trade, the environment, technology, or security. People who practice diplomacy are called diplomats.
Well definition. You stick to the matter in hand and use the classic definitions, that is great. Also you use more current definitions that define diplomacy not only as the representation of states but also of different political communities. Great.
Love that you included groups and individuals, I did as well. Going off of that though, I would say that the issues that involve diplomacy span far wider than the issues on the international stage or even public policy. And diplomacy can be practiced by people who are not diplomats.
